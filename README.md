See the introductory vignette for an introduction. The Dutch MDMA Policy
Think Tank that was active in 2019-2020 used this package to formulate
policy recommendations. The rendered report of that project, including
all code, is located at <https://denktank.gitlab.io/mdma-policy-mdmcda>;
the corresponding Git repository at
<https://gitlab.com/denktank/mdma-policy-mdmcda>; and the accompanying
Open Science Framework repository which contains frozen registrations at
<https://osf.io/h58r6>.

Other R packages for MCDA are [the `MCDA`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MCDA), [the `MCDM`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MCDM), and
[`DecisionAnalysis`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DecisionAnalysis).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `mdmcda` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages('mdmcda');
```

You can install the development version of `mdmcda` from
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/mdmcda');
```

If you want the even more cutting edge version, you can install from the
`dev` branch (as opposed to the default branch, `prod`) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/mdmcda@dev');
```

(This is assuming you have the `remotes` packages installed; otherwise,
install that first using the `install.packages` function.)
